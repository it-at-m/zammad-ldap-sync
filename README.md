# Zammad-Ldap-Synchronsiation
In order to assign an owner to Zammad tickets for processing, we need a structured representation of our LDAP entries in Zammad. 

Zammad tickets holders must be mapped to our LDAP users.

The project enables the transfer of our LDAP *organizational units* and *users* to Zammad *groups* and *users*.

Changes in LDAP must be able to be periodically synchronized in Zammad.

### Built With

* Spring boot
  * REST
  * LDAP / [ezLDAP](https://github.com/it-at-m/ezLDAP)
* Openapi
* [Zammad REST API](https://docs.zammad.org/en/latest/api/intro.html)

## Roadmap

*TODO...*

See the [open issues](#) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).


## Set up
For the LDAP-Zammad Synchronization we create an LDAP tree consisting of the organizational units and their employees. We call this a *shade tree*.
To do this, the data must be read from LDAP. The implementation fits our LDAP structure. If the LDAP structure is different, appropriate adjustments are required, to build the shade tree.

The shade tree is then used to synchronize the groups and users in Zammd via REST API.

Prepare Zammad before first start. Technical documentation can be found here [docs/Readme](https://github.com/it-at-m/zammad-ldap-sync/blob/dev/docs/README.md)

application.yaml:
- Connect zammad-ldap-snyc with Zammad REST-API (Url, Token).
- Connect zammad-ldap-snyc with your LDAP.

Start Zammad-Ldap-Synchronisation application.

Request Openapi documentation http(s)://[url:port]/swagger-ui/index.html.

Start synchronisation process with correct rest ressource.

## Documentation
Why don't we use the [Zammad LDAP](https://admin-docs.zammad.org/en/latest/system/integrations/ldap/index.html) integration?

The native Zammad LDAP integration is capable of importing LDAP users and adding them to existing Zammad roles depending on a group mapping in LDAP.
However, not supported is to create and update the zammad group structure depending on a structure in LDAP. 

In the LHM we have a separate object structure in our LDAP representing the organizational structure, starting from `o=Landeshauptstadt MÃ¼nchen`.
Our users are located in the same LDAP tree but starting from `o=lhm`. The user objects are referencing the orga objects via the attribute `lhmObjectReference`.

In the LDAP-Sync we iterate both the user structure (creating Zammad users) and the orga structure (creating Zammad groups) and also link the users to the groups corresponding to the user-to-orga-mapping in LDAP.
